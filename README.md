# Demo Reddit Client App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is a demo app using the reddit json API, rendering a basic example of how you could make a similar application.

## The purpose of this project

- I created the project to exhibit and practice skills I had recently learned including react and redux
- Continued practice in frontend design
- This was a suggested project in an online web design course and I thought it would be good practice to build a project not motivated by my own needs

## If I were to continue working on this project I would:

- fix the major frontend flaw that videos and picture carousels do not currently render as they have a different data format on the API
- iron out a couple of small flaws in the frontend design
- Normalize and memoize the state for better performance
- add a bit of interactivity (allow commenting and liking on posts)
